# Grokking Algorithms

A collection of various algorithms implemented in JavaScript that are applicable to a wide variety of programming problems. The algorithms presented are discussed in depth in the book *Grokking Algorithms* by Aditya Y. Bhargava.  Sorting, searching, hashing, compression, and AI alogrithms are presented.  


## Getting Started

`git clone https://github.com/marciandmnd/grokking-algorithms.git`
